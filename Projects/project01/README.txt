Hours to complete project: 2
Feedback: 

Overall, the project was fairly straightforward. I was pretty rusty on linked lists and even a little bit on Python so it took longer than I would have liked. I did however need to look up how to reverse a linked list (knew it involved more than two variables just couldnt fully implement it correctly).
